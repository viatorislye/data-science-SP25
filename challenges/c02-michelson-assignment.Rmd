*Purpose*: When studying physical problems, there is an important
distinction between *error* and *uncertainty*. The primary purpose of
this challenge is to dip our toes into these factors by analyzing a real
dataset.

*Reading*: [Experimental Determination of the Velocity of
Light](https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=343nAAAAMAAJ&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA115)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(googlesheets4)

url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1av_SXn4j0-4Rk0mQFik3LLr-uf0YdA06i3ugE6n-Zdo/edit?usp=sharing"

# Parameters
LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM    <- 299792.458 # Exact speed of light in a vacuum (km / s)
LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON <- 299944.00  # Michelson's speed estimate (km / s)
LIGHTSPEED_PM        <- 51         # Michelson error estimate (km / s)
```

*Background*: In 1879 Albert Michelson led an experimental campaign to
measure the speed of light. His approach was a development upon the
method of Foucault[3], and resulted in a new estimate of
$v_0 = 299944 \pm 51$ kilometers per second (in a vacuum). This is very
close to the modern *exact* value of `r LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM`. In this
challenge, you will analyze Michelson's original data, and explore some
of the factors associated with his experiment.

I've already copied Michelson's data from his 1880 publication; the code
chunk below will load these data from a public googlesheet.

*Aside*: The speed of light is *exact* (there is **zero error** in the
value `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM`) because the meter is actually
[*defined*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre#Speed_of_light_definition)
in terms of the speed of light!

```{r read-sheet}
## Note: No need to edit this chunk!
gs4_deauth()
ss <- gs4_get(url)
df_michelson <-
  read_sheet(ss) %>%
  select(Date, Distinctness, Temp, Velocity) %>%
  mutate(Distinctness = as_factor(Distinctness))

df_michelson %>% glimpse()
```

*Data dictionary*:

-   `Date`: Date of measurement
-   `Distinctness`: Distinctness of measured images: 3 = good, 2 = fair,
    1 = poor
-   `Temp`: Ambient temperature (Fahrenheit)
-   `Velocity`: Measured speed of light (km / s)

### **q1** Re-create the following table (from Michelson (1880), pg. 139) using `df_michelson` and `dplyr`. Note that your values *will not* match those of Michelson *exactly*; why might this be?

| Distinctness | n   | MeanVelocity |
|--------------|-----|--------------|
| 3            | 46  | 299860       |
| 2            | 39  | 299860       |
| 1            | 15  | 299810       |

```{r q1-task}
## TODO: Compute summaries
df_q1 <- df_michelson %>% 
  group_by(Distinctness) %>% 
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    MeanVelocity = mean(Velocity))
      
df_q1 %>%
  arrange(desc(Distinctness)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

**Observations**: - Write your observations here! - There are a lot more
observation with distinctness 3 & 2 versus 1. Both 2 & 3 distinctness
also have a similar velocity value of \~299860 - Why might your table
differ from Michelson's? - A different number of sig fig or round or
obersavater error.

The `Velocity` values in the dataset are the speed of light *in air*;
Michelson introduced a couple of adjustments to estimate the speed of
light in a vacuum. In total, he added $+92$ km/s to his mean estimate
for `VelocityVacuum` (from Michelson (1880), pg. 141). While the
following isn't fully rigorous ($+92$ km/s is based on the mean
temperature), we'll simply apply this correction to all the observations
in the dataset.

### **q2** Create a new variable `VelocityVacuum` with the $+92$ km/s adjustment to `Velocity`. Assign this new dataframe to `df_q2`.

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Adjust the data, assign to df_q2
df_q2 <- 
  df_michelson %>% 
  mutate(
    VelocityVacuum = (Velocity + 92))
    

df_q2
```

As part of his study, Michelson assessed the various potential sources
of error, and provided his best-guess for the error in his
speed-of-light estimate. These values are provided in
`LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON`---his nominal estimate---and
`LIGHTSPEED_PM`---plus/minus bounds on his estimate. Put differently,
Michelson believed the true value of the speed-of-light probably lay
between `LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON - LIGHTSPEED_PM` and
`LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON + LIGHTSPEED_PM`.

Let's introduce some terminology:[2]

-   **Error** is the difference between a true value and an estimate of
    that value; for instance `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM - LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON`.
-   **Uncertainty** is an analyst's *assessment* of the error.

Since a "true" value is often not known in practice, one generally does
not know the error. The best they can do is quantify their degree of
uncertainty. We will learn some means of quantifying uncertainty in this
class, but for many real problems uncertainty includes some amount of
human judgment.[2]

### **q3** Compare Michelson's speed of light estimate against the modern speed of light value. Is Michelson's estimate of the error (his uncertainty) greater or less than the true error?

```{r q3-task}
## TODO: Compare Michelson's estimate and error against the true value
#True <- LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM
#True_E <- LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM - LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON
#cat("Lightspeed Vacumm", True, "km/s ")
#cat("True error", True_E, "km/s ")
#Lower_bound <- (LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON - LIGHTSPEED_PM) 
#Upper_bound<- (LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON + LIGHTSPEED_PM)
#Error <- LIGHTSPEED_PM
#cat("Michelson's lower bound", Lower_bound, "km/s")
#cat("Michelson's upper bound", Upper_bound, "km/s")
#Range <- Upper_bound- Lower_bound
#cat("Michelson Error", Error, "km/s")
#cat("Michelson range", Range, "km/s")
## Your code here!


### Correction
percent_error_uncertainty = abs(LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM - LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON) / LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM * 100
percent_error_uncertainty

#Michelson's error is about 3 times his estimate 

M_Estimate <-LIGHTSPEED_PM

M_Error <- abs(LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM - LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON)


M_Estimate
M_Error

```

```{r pleaseIgnoreForPresentation}
#df_q2 %>% 
 # ggplot(aes(Date, Velocity)) +
  #geom_hline(
  #  yintercept = LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON,
   # color = rgb(1,0,0)
 # ) +
  #geom_hline(
  #  yintercept = Lower_bound,
  #  color = rgb(0,0,1)
 # ) +
  #geom_hline(
 #   yintercept = Upper_bound,
 #   color = rgb(0,0,1)
  #) +
  #  geom_hline(
 #   yintercept = True
 # )
  
```

**Observations**: - Is Michelson's estimate of the error (his
uncertainty) greater or less than the true error? - It is less than
Michelson being 51 km/s while the error was 151.542 km/s being in the
negative direction as the actual light speed was smaller. - Make a
quantitative comparison between Michelson's uncertainty and his error. -
The percent error of his uncertainty to the true was \|(51 -
151.542)\|/151.542 = .663 or 66.3%

The following plot shows all of Michelson's data as a [control
chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_chart); this sort of plot
is common in manufacturing, where it is used to help determine if a
manufacturing process is under [statistical
control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control).
Each dot is one of Michelson's measurements, and the grey line connects
the mean taken for each day. The same plot also shows simulated data
using a probability model. We'll get into statistics later in the
course; for now, let's focus on understanding what real and simulated
data tend to look like.

### **q4** Inspect the following plot with the `Real` Michelson data and `Simulated` data from a probability model. Document the similarities and differences between the data under *observe* below.

```{r q4-cf-real-simulated}
## Note: No need to edit this chunk!
## Calibrate simulated data
v_mean <-
  df_q2 %>%
  summarize(m = mean(VelocityVacuum)) %>%
  pull(m)
v_sd <-
  df_q2 %>%
  summarize(s = sd(VelocityVacuum)) %>%
  pull(s)

## Visualize
set.seed(101)
df_q2 %>%
  mutate(Simulated = rnorm(n(), mean = v_mean, sd = v_sd)) %>%
  rename(Real = VelocityVacuum) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(Simulated, Real),
    names_to = "source",
    values_to = "velocity"
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(Date, velocity)) +
  geom_hline(
    yintercept = LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON,
    linetype = "dotted"
  ) +
  geom_hline(
    yintercept = LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON - LIGHTSPEED_PM,
    linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  geom_hline(
    yintercept = LIGHTSPEED_MICHELSON + LIGHTSPEED_PM,
    linetype = "dashed"
  ) +

  geom_line(
    data = . %>%
      group_by(Date, source) %>%
      summarize(velocity_mean = mean(velocity)),
    mapping = aes(y = velocity_mean),
    color = "grey50"
  ) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(y = velocity),
    size = 0.8
  ) +

  facet_grid(source~.) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Date of Measurement (1879)",
    y = "Velocity (in Vacuum)"
  )
```

**Observations**: Similarities - They both have similar upper, lower
bounds and average velocity. - Both have points above and below the line
Differences - Simulated uses a lot more data point and has a more
frequent days of measurement than the real - The real have a lot of data
outside the bounds in the beginning (Maybe atmospheric pressure affected
measurements)

### **q5** You have access to a few other variables. Construct a **at least three** visualizations of `VelocityVacuum` against these other factors. Are there other patterns in the data that might help explain the difference between Michelson's estimate and `LIGHTSPEED_VACUUM`?

```{r q5}
df_q2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Date, VelocityVacuum, color = Distinctness))+
  geom_point() 
  
df_q2 %>%  
  ggplot(aes(Distinctness, VelocityVacuum, fill = Distinctness))+
  geom_boxplot()

df_q2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Temp,VelocityVacuum, color = Distinctness))+
  geom_point()

```

**Observations**: Graph 1: - Velocity was higher on average in the
beginning of the month versus the end - A lot of distinctness 1
observations occurred around \~Jun 13-14 - Observations collected on the
same day tended to have the same distinctness

Graph 2: - Distinctness 1 had the low average speed that was also closer
to the actual speed of light - Distinctness 3 has the largest range of
velocity values - Distinctness 2 has the smallest range of velocity
values - There is a trend with highest velocity the higher the
distinctness is

Graph 3 (VelocityVacuum Vs Temp) - Majority of the observation collect
was above 70 degree - Below 70 degrees, the majority of distinctness 1
observations occurs - I don't believe there was a strong collation
between vacuum velocity & temperature

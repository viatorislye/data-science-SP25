*Purpose*: Learning to do EDA well takes practice! In this challenge
you’ll further practice EDA by first completing a guided exploration,
then by conducting your own investigation. This challenge will also give
you a chance to use the wide variety of visual tools we’ve been
learning.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

*Background*: [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/about-gapminder/) is
an independent organization that seeks to educate people about the state
of the world. They seek to counteract the worldview constructed by a
hype-driven media cycle, and promote a “fact-based worldview” by
focusing on data. The dataset we’ll study in this challenge is from
Gapminder.

# Guided EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

First, we’ll go through a round of *guided EDA*. Try to pay attention to
the high-level process we’re going through—after this guided round
you’ll be responsible for doing another cycle of EDA on your own!

### **q0** Perform your “first checks” on the dataset. What variables are in this

dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Do your "first checks" here!
gapminder %>% 
  summary()
```

**Observations**:

- Country, continent, year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap

### **q1** Determine the most and least recent years in the `gapminder` dataset.

*Hint*: Use the `pull()` function to get a vector out of a tibble.
(Rather than the `$` notation of base R.)

``` r
## TASK: Find the largest and smallest values of `year` in `gapminder`
year_max <-
  gapminder %>%
  pull(year) %>%
  max()

year_min <-
  gapminder %>%
  pull(year) %>%
  min()
```

Use the following test to check your work.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change this
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 7 == 5)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_max %% 3 == 0)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 7 == 6)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(year_min %% 3 == 2)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
if (is_tibble(year_max)) {
  print("year_max is a tibble; try using `pull()` to get a vector")
  assertthat::assert_that(False)
}

print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

### **q2** Filter on years matching `year_min`, and make a plot of the GDP per capita against continent. Choose an appropriate `geom_` to visualize the data. What observations can you make?

You may encounter difficulties in visualizing these data; if so document
your challenges and attempt to produce the most informative visual you
can.

``` r
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == year_min) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent,gdpPercap, color = continent)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q2-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Asia has a really rich country (Kuwait)
- Africa has the lowest gdp per cap on average
- Europe has a more distributed range of country with gdp per cap

**Difficulties & Approaches**:

- I struggled with getting the filter to work (understanding the pull()
  function).
- It is hard to read the gdp per cap of each Continent when Kuwait
  changed the whole graph.
- Oceania only have two country in this date set so I didn’t include it
  while trying to find the outliers.

### **q3** You should have found *at least* three outliers in q2 (but possibly many more!). Identify those outliers (figure out which countries they are).

``` r
## TASK: Identify the outliers from q2
Top_asia <-
  gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>% 
  filter(year == year_min) %>% 
  filter(gdpPercap == max(gdpPercap))

Top_europe <-
  gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Europe") %>% 
  filter(year == year_min) %>% 
  filter(gdpPercap == max(gdpPercap))

Top_america <-
  gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Americas") %>% 
  filter(year == year_min) %>% 
  filter(gdpPercap == max(gdpPercap))

Top_asia
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 6
    ##   country continent  year lifeExp    pop gdpPercap
    ##   <fct>   <fct>     <int>   <dbl>  <int>     <dbl>

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 6

    ##   <fct>       <fct>     <int>   <dbl>   <int>     <dbl>
    ## 1 Switzerland Europe     1952    69.6 4815000    14734.

``` r
Top_america
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 6
    ##   country       continent  year lifeExp       pop gdpPercap
    ##   <fct>         <fct>     <int>   <dbl>     <int>     <dbl>
    ## 1 United States Americas   1952    68.4 157553000    13990.

**Observations**:

- Identify the outlier countries from q2
  - I chose the top 3 country with highest gdps on the graph, United
    States, Switzerland,& Kuwait

*Hint*: For the next task, it’s helpful to know a ggplot trick we’ll
learn in an upcoming exercise: You can use the `data` argument inside
any `geom_*` to modify the data that will be plotted *by that geom
only*. For instance, you can use this trick to filter a set of points to
label:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit, use ideas from this in q4 below
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%

  ggplot(aes(continent, lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("United Kingdom", "Japan", "Zambia")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  )
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/layer-filter-1.png)<!-- -->

### **q4** Create a plot similar to yours from q2 studying both `year_min` and `year_max`. Find a way to highlight the outliers from q3 on your plot *in a way that lets you identify which country is which*. Compare the patterns between `year_min` and `year_max`.

*Hint*: We’ve learned a lot of different ways to show multiple
variables; think about using different aesthetics or facets.

``` r
## TASK: Create a visual of gdpPercap vs continent
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == year_min | year == year_max) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent,gdpPercap, fill = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = . %>% filter(country %in% c("United States", "Kuwait", "Switzerland")),
    mapping = aes(color = country),
    size = 2
  ) +
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- I didn’t know how to align the country single values with the
  as.factor(year).
- Switzerland was the highest gdp per cap in Europe in 1952 and not
  longer the highest in 2007.
- The US is the highest gdp per cap for america in 1952 & 2007.
- Kuwait was an extreme outlier in 1952 but in 2007 it’s the top of the
  line on the boxplot/the rest of Asia’s gdp per cap increased.

# Your Own EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Now it’s your turn! We just went through guided EDA considering the GDP
per capita at two time points. You can continue looking at outliers,
consider different years, repeat the exercise with `lifeExp`, consider
the relationship between variables, or something else entirely.

### **q5** Create *at least* three new figures below. With each figure, try to pose new questions about the data.

``` r
## TASK: Your first graph
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == year_max) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap,lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task1-1.png)<!-- -->

- Generally, the higher the gdp per cap a country has, the longer the
  life expectancy is for those who live in that country

``` r
## TASK: Your second graph
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == year_max) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap,pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task2-1.png)<!-- -->

- Population and gdp per cap do not have a correlation between each
  other

``` r
## TASK: Your third graph
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(as.factor(year),gdpPercap)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](c04-gapminder-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task3-1.png)<!-- -->

- The mean gdp per cap tends to increase but the spread of gdp as also
  increase as time goes on.

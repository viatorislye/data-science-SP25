*Purpose*: We’ve been learning how to quantify uncertainty in estimates
through the exercises; now its time to put those skills to use studying
real data. In this challenge we’ll use concepts like confidence
intervals to help us make sense of census data.

Error](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/webinars/2020/calculating-margins-of-error-acs.html)

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

You might wonder why the `Margin of Error` in the population estimates
is listed as `*****`. From the [documentation (PDF
link)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj81Omy16TrAhXsguAKHTzKDQEQFjABegQIBxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.census.gov%2Fprograms-surveys%2Facs%2Ftech_docs%2Faccuracy%2FMultiyearACSAccuracyofData2018.pdf%3F&usg=AOvVaw2TOrVuBDlkDI2gde6ugce_)
for the ACS:

> If the margin of error is displayed as ‘\*\*\*\*\*’ (five asterisks),
> the estimate has been controlled to be equal to a fixed value and so
> it has no sampling error. A standard error of zero should be used for
> these controlled estimates when completing calculations, such as those
> in the following section.

This means that for cases listed as `*****` the US Census Bureau
recommends treating the margin of error (and thus standard error) as
zero.

### **q2** Obtain median income data from the Census Bureau:

- `Filter > Topics > Income and Poverty > Income and Poverty`
- `Filter > Geography > County > All counties in United States`
- Look for `Median Income in the Past 12 Months` (Table S1903)
- Download the 2018 5-year ACS estimates; save to your `data` folder and
  add the filename below.

``` r
## TODO: Give the filename for your copy of Table S1903
filename_income <- "./data/ACSST5Y2018.S1903-Data.csv"

## NOTE: No need to edit

Use the following test to check that you downloaded the correct file:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit, use to check you got the right file.
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_income %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001") %>%
    pull(`Estimate!!Percent Distribution!!FAMILY INCOME BY FAMILY SIZE!!2-person families`)
  == 45.6
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Well done!")
```

    ## [1] "Well done!"

This dataset is in desperate need of some *tidying*. To simplify the
task, we’ll start by considering the `\\d-person families` columns
first.

### **q3** Tidy the `df_income` dataset by completing the code below. Pivot and rename the columns to arrive at the column names `id, geographic_area_name, category, income_estimate, income_moe`.

*Hint*: You can do this in a single pivot using the `".value"` argument
and a `names_pattern` using capture groups `"()"`. Remember that you can
use an OR operator `|` in a regex to allow for multiple possibilities in
a capture group, for example `"(Estimate|Margin of Error)"`.

``` r
df_q3 <-
  df_income %>%
  select(
    Geography,
    contains("Geographic"),
    # This will select only the numeric d-person family columns;
    # it will ignore the annotation columns
    contains("median") & matches("\\d-person families") & !contains("Annotation of")
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(contains("median"), as.numeric)) %>%
## TODO: Pivot the data, rename the columns
  pivot_longer(
    names_pattern = "(Estimate|Margin of Error).*(\\d-person families).*",
    names_to = c(".value","category"),
    cols = matches("(Estimate|Margin of Error)")
  ) %>% 
  rename("income_estimate" = "Estimate", 
         "income_moe" = "Margin of Error", 
         "geographic_area_name" = "Geographic Area Name") %>%
  glimpse()
```

    ## Warning: There were 8 warnings in `mutate()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `across(contains("median"), as.numeric)`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! NAs introduced by coercion

Use the following tests to check your work:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q3),
  c("Geography", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe")
))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_q3 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_moe)
  == 6663
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

The data gives finite values for the Margin of Error, which is closely
related to the Standard Error. The Census Bureau documentation gives the
following relationship between Margin of Error and Standard Error:

$$\text{MOE} = 1.645 \times \text{SE}.$$

### **q4** Convert the margin of error to standard error. Additionally, compute a 99% confidence interval on income, and normalize the standard error to `income_CV = income_SE / income_estimate`. Provide these columns with the names `income_SE, income_lo, income_hi, income_CV`.

``` r
df_q4<-
  df_q3 %>% 
  mutate(
    income_SE = income_moe / 1.645,
    income_CV = income_SE / income_estimate,
    income_lo = income_estimate - qnorm( 1 - (1 - 0.99) / 2 ) * income_SE,
    income_hi = income_estimate + qnorm( 1 - (1 - 0.99) / 2 ) * income_SE,
  )
```

Use the following tests to check your work:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q4),
  c("Geography", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe",
    "income_SE", "income_lo", "income_hi", "income_CV")
))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_SE) - 4050.456
  ) / 4050.456 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_lo) - 54513.72
  ) / 54513.72 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_hi) - 75380.28
  ) / 75380.28 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(Geography == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_CV) - 0.06236556
  ) / 0.06236556 < 1e-3
)
```

    ## [1] TRUE

``` r
print("Nice!")
```

    ## [1] "Nice!"

One last wrangling step: We need to join the two datasets so we can
compare population with income.

### **q5** Join `df_q4` and `df_pop`.

``` r
## TODO: Join df_q4 and df_pop by the appropriate column

df_data<-
  df_q4 %>%
  left_join(
    df_pop,
    by = "Geography"
  )
```

# Analysis

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

We now have both estimates and confidence intervals for
`\\d-person families`. Now we can compare cases with quantified
uncertainties: Let’s practice!

### **q6** Study the following graph, making sure to note what you can *and can’t* conclude based on the estimates and confidence intervals. Document your observations below and answer the questions.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
wid <- 0.5

df_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Massachusetts")) %>%
  mutate(
    county = str_remove(geographic_area_name, " County,.*$"),
    county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(county, income_estimate, color = category)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = income_lo, ymax = income_hi),
    position = position_dodge(width = wid)
  ) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = wid)) +

  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "County",
    y = "Median Household Income"
  )
```

**Observations**:

- Document your observations here.
  - Nantucket has a large error bar going from ~10,000 to 275000
    dollars.
  - Norfolk seems to have the higher median household income across all
    households on average for all counties
  - Four & five person household tend to have the highest median
    household income across all counties
- Can you confidently distinguish between household incomes in Suffolk
  county? Why or why not?
  - Sort of as the color help distinguish them from each other however
    they are so similar it is hard to read
- Which counties have the widest confidence intervals?
  - Nantucket has the largest 3 & 5 person confidence interval
  - Hampsire has the largest 6 person confidence interval
  - Dukes has the largest 2& 4 person confidence interval

In the next task you’ll investigate the relationship between population
and uncertainty.

### **q7** Plot the standard error against population for all counties. Create a visual that effectively highlights the trends in the data. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint*: Remember that standard error is a function of *both* variability
(e.g. variance) and sample size.

``` r
df_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(population_estimate,income_SE, color = category)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  geom_smooth(color = "black") +
  theme_minimal()
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

    ## Warning: Removed 814 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range
    ## (`stat_smooth()`).

    ## Warning: Removed 814 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

**Observations**:

- What *overall* trend do you see between `SE` and population? Why might
  this trend exist?
  - There seems to be a of a the higher the population estimate is the
    smaller the income standard error is. This may exist because large
    population (cities) are located where there is a higher minimum
    wages and and to afford living in the cities, you must have certain
    income to afford it. It can also be that there are more income to
    compare to in cities versus rural communities where outliners can
    affect the standard error more
- What does this *overall* trend tell you about the relative ease of
  studying small vs large counties?
  - When there is more people to compare to each other, it is easier to
    get a more actual estimate. More data points = more realizations

Now it’s your turn! You have income data for every county in the United
States: Pose your own question and try to answer it with the data.

### **q8** Pose your own question about the data. Create a visualization (or table) here, and document your observations.

``` r
## TODO: Pose and answer your own question about the data
df_data %>% 
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Vermont")) %>% 
  mutate(
    county = str_remove(geographic_area_name, " County,.*$"),
    county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(population_estimate, income_estimate)) +
  geom_point() +

  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "Population Estimate by County",
    y = "Median Household Income",
  ) +
  facet_wrap(vars(category))
```

``` r
df_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Vermont")) %>%
  mutate(
    county = str_remove(geographic_area_name, " County,.*$"),
    county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(county, income_estimate, color = category)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = income_lo, ymax = income_hi),
    position = position_dodge(width = wid)
  ) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = wid)) +

  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "County",
    y = "Median Household Income"
  )
```

**Observations**:

- I made two graphs
- The first graphs did not show a big correlation between population and
  median income
- There is an outlier in county population in Vermont which is
  Chittenden county, where Burlington is located. This however did not
  mean they earned the more income by county in Vermont. Only for 2,3,4
  person house were that at the top or tied with another county.
- I made the second graph as I found it weird that Essex county had an
  error bar that went from -30,000 to over 150,000 for 6 person
  households. I think there might just not be many 6 person household in
  the county.

Ideas:

- Compare trends across counties that are relevant to you; e.g. places
  you’ve lived, places you’ve been, places in the US that are
  interesting to you.
- In q3 we tidied the median `\\d-person families` columns only.
  - Tidy the other median columns to learn about other people groups.
  - Tidy the percentage columns to learn about how many households of
    each category are in each county.
- Your own idea!
